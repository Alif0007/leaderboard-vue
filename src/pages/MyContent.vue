        “Professional sellers who think like owners of their territories take
        more accountability for their outcomes and success, no matter what’s
        going on around them. They find a way, every time, to make their number.
        In doing so, they usually create higher value for their clients, higher
        margins for their organization, and maximize their commission checks. If
        you’re a sales leader, think about your team for a moment.”

        Connection With Prospect Excerpt:"Have you ever been in a sales meeting
        and asked all the right questions, listened intently, but still feel
        like there is a disconnect in the conversation? I sure have! It’s times
        like these that you have to lean on your emotional intelligence to be
        aware enough to pause your agenda and take a step back. There are some
        buyer styles that simply don’t enjoy having off-topic conversations and
        dislike the entire process of building rapport. They see it as a waste

        Read this post: 3 cold email mistakes that ruin sales conversations
        Excerpt: “If you’re selling to a broad range of titles and industries,
        it can be tempting to aim for the most generic message possible that
        could appeal to anyone on your list. Instead of narrowing down your
        audience and your value propositions, you pick the broadest reasons why
        someone would choose to buy your product or work with your company. And
        it doesn’t work. It never does.”

        customers isn’t sales — it’s product Excerpt: “In addition to speaking
        with as many potential users as possible, there are other methods of
        ascertaining the effectiveness and necessity of your product. For
        example, I suggest employing the always illuminating toothbrush test,
        which, simply put, means understanding how many times your users log
        into your product each day. Is it twice per day (the same amount of
        times they’d use a toothbrush)? If so, you’ve likely hit on a pretty
        powerful need.”

        used to develop highly effective phone or email messages that highlight
        your buyers’ primary issues/challenges and the key business results your
        product, service or solution addresses. They can also be used to create

        Help You Go Deeper Excerpt: "Buyers who show up to sales meetings
        totally cold and unprepared usually make for ineffective conversation.
        Unfortunately, this happens rather frequently. It is the responsibility
        of the salesperson to ensure the buyer is just as prepared as you. The
        best sellers subscribe to the saying “if it’s to be, it’s up to me.” You
        can accomplish this by sharing a “pre-read” before your first discovery

        to Avoid as a Sales Manager in 2023, According to Vendux LLC's Founder
        Exerpt: "One of my first customer visits as a young sales manager was in
        support of a salesperson — with a client I hadn't met before. Prior to
        the visit, we had done a lot of technical work for the client's company,
        substantially improving its product. However, being a supplier offering
        significant technical service, our product's price wasn't exactly cheap.
        As a result, the customer had researched other supply sources — and as
        we sat down for the meeting, he told us that he could buy the same
        product for half the price."
